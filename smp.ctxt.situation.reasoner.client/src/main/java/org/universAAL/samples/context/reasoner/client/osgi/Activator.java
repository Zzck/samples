/**
 * 
 * This bundle offers classes to get access and make changes on the situation
 * reasoner. The basic idea behind this to not force a programmer to take use of
 * the basic universAAL functionality but use the reasoner with simple method
 * calls like provided by the ReasoningCaller. In addition there is the class
 * ContextEventRecorder that record all events at the context-bus (and therefore
 * possible Type-URI's, instances and its URI's in the system, ... ). This can
 * be used to offer possibilities for the elements of the Situations, Queries
 * and Rules to a user and therefore simplify the process of creating them. The
 * class CHECaller can be used to perform SPARQL-Queries at the CHE.
